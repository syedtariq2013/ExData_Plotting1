## Notes on Course Project 1

The results of the project have been placed in 2 subdirectories of the Github repository:

* <b>plots</b>: contains the 4 plots - plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png
* <b>source</b>: contains the four source files - plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R

While the evaluation does not require that the code be executed by the evaluator, it is important to install the package "sqldf" to correctly execute the program.
